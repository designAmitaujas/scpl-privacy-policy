When you use our application, we do not directly collect personal information from you. Instead, we rely on the credentials provided by your organization for authentication purposes. These credentials typically include your email address and password.

Additionally, to enable the feature of sharing images, the SCPL application requires access to your device's media library. This access is necessary for employees to attach images to entries within the application.

Your email address and password are used solely for authentication purposes. We verify your identity using these credentials to grant you access to the features and functionalities of the SCPL application.

The media access permission is utilized solely within the SCPL application for the purpose of enabling employees to share images as part of their interactions. We do not access or store any media content from your device beyond what is explicitly shared within the SCPL application.

Sharing Your Information

Rest assured, all data collected and generated within the SCPL application, including your personal information and any shared media content, remains within the secure confines of your organization. We do not share this information with any third parties.

Your Choices

As an employee of the organization, your choice to use the SCPL application implies consent to provide your email address, password, and media access for sharing images. Without these permissions, you will be unable to access certain features and functionalities offered by the application.
